JVM is called abstract virtual machine because it does not exist physically, it is kind of specification that provides
a secure runtime environment to execute the bytecode generated through the compiler, JVM actually invokes main( ) method present in the Java program.


JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer
can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled 
system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.
